 <paragraph index="10" node_type="writer">Explanation of the Research Proposal</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="11" node_type="writer">Your research focuses on making AI-powered text generation more energy-efficient using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. Here’s a breakdown of the key points:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="12" node_type="writer">1️⃣ Problem Statement (Why This Research?)</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="13" node_type="writer">🔹 Generative AI models (like Llama 3-70B) consume a lot of energy, making them expensive and unsustainable.
🔹 Green AI principles aim to make AI more efficient without sacrificing performance.
🔹 Current models rely on large-scale computations, leading to high costs and carbon footprint.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="14" node_type="writer">2️⃣ Research Objective (What Will You Achieve?)</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="15" node_type="writer">✅ Develop an energy-efficient generative text model using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
✅ Use FAISS (Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search) to store and retrieve knowledge without generating everything from scratch.
✅ Optimize computation by reducing model size, improving search efficiency, and lowering hardware usage.
✅ Measure energy savings and computational costs to prove the effectiveness of this approach.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="16" node_type="writer">3️⃣ Methodology (How Will You Do It?)</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="17" node_type="writer">🔹 Step 1: Preprocess Documents → Store PDF data as vector embeddings using HuggingFace.
🔹 Step 2: Efficient Search with FAISS → Retrieve only relevant knowledge instead of generating everything.
🔹 Step 3: Generate Responses via Llama 3-70B (Groq API) → Use retrieved documents as context for response generation.
🔹 Step 4: Optimize Energy Usage → Reduce computation by using smaller models, faster retrieval, and efficient hardware.
🔹 Step 5: Measure Efficiency → Track power consumption, response time, and cost reduction.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="18" node_type="writer">4️⃣ Expected Outcome (What Will This Research Deliver?)</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="19" node_type="writer">✅ Faster AI Responses → By retrieving only needed information, rather than generating from scratch.
✅ Lower Energy Costs → Uses less GPU/CPU power, making AI more sustainable.
✅ Cheaper AI Deployment → Reduces API costs and hardware requirements.
✅ Greener AI → Aligns with Green AI principles, reducing carbon footprint.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="20" node_type="writer">1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="21" node_type="writer">Think of RAG like a smart assistant with a search engine built in. Instead of just replying with what it already knows, it searches for extra information before answering.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="22" node_type="writer">🔹 How it Works:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="23" node_type="writer">You ask a question. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="24" node_type="writer">The AI retrieves relevant documents from a database or the web. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="25" node_type="writer">It combines the retrieved information with its own knowledge. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="26" node_type="writer">It generates a well-informed response. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="27" node_type="writer">💡 Example:
If you ask, “What are the latest AI models in 2025?”, a regular AI might give outdated info. But with RAG, it retrieves fresh details from online sources and generates an up-to-date answer.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="28" node_type="writer">2. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) Vector Store</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="29" node_type="writer">FAISS is a tool that helps AI find similar data quickly. It stores information in a special format called vectors (numbers that represent words, images, or documents).</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="30" node_type="writer">🔹 Why FAISS?</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="31" node_type="writer">It makes searching millions of documents super fast. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="32" node_type="writer">It helps AI understand which words or sentences are similar. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="33" node_type="writer">💡 Example:
Imagine Google Search, but instead of matching exact words, it finds results based on meaning. If you search for “big cat”, FAISS might return “tiger” or “lion” because they are related in meaning.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="34" node_type="writer">3. Groq API (LLaMA 3-70B)</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="35" node_type="writer">Groq API is a service that runs AI models super fast. It is designed to process text much faster than regular AI models.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="36" node_type="writer">🔹 Why is it special?</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="37" node_type="writer">It can generate text at ~500 words per second. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="38" node_type="writer">It runs on a special AI chip instead of regular GPUs, making it lightning fast. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="39" node_type="writer">It supports models like LLaMA 3-70B (Meta's powerful AI model). </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="40" node_type="writer">💡 Example:
If you chat with an AI assistant using Groq API, you won’t experience delays—it responds instantly, even for long conversations!</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="41" node_type="writer">Putting It All Together</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="42" node_type="writer">📌 RAG = AI fetches real-time data to improve answers.
📌 FAISS = AI stores and searches data quickly using smart math.
📌 Groq API = AI runs super fast, making real-time conversations smooth.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="44" node_type="writer">1. What is This Research About?</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="45" node_type="writer">This research aims to improve the energy efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by using a smart retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. It combines multiple technologies, including FAISS, Hugging Face embeddings, and the Groq API (Llama 3-70B).</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="46" node_type="writer">🔹 Why?
LLMs require a lot of computing power, which consumes energy and increases costs. This research aligns with Green AI principles, which focus on reducing energy use while maintaining high AI performance.</paragraph>

 <paragraph index="91" node_type="writer">Green AI: Meaning and Importance</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="92" node_type="writer">Green AI refers to the practice of developing and using artificial intelligence (AI) in an energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable way. The goal is to reduce the carbon footprint and computational costs of AI models while maintaining or even improving their performance.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="94" node_type="writer">Why Is Green AI Important?</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="95" node_type="writer">🔹 AI consumes a lot of energy – Training large AI models like GPT-4 or Llama 3-70B requires thousands of GPUs running for weeks, leading to high electricity consumption.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="96" node_type="writer">🔹 High carbon footprint – AI models contribute to climate change due to the heavy use of data centers powered by fossil fuels.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="97" node_type="writer">🔹 Expensive computation – Running large models is costly, making AI less accessible for small businesses and researchers.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="98" node_type="writer">🔹 Sustainability – Green AI ensures that technological advancements do not come at the cost of environmental harm.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="100" node_type="writer">Types of Green AI Approaches</paragraph>
