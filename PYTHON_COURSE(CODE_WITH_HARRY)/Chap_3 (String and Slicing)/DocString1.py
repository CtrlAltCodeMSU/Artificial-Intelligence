  """
  Zen of Python
  Beautiful is better than ugly: Code should be aesthetically pleasing and well-structured.
Explicit is better than implicit: Code should be clear and obvious rather than relying on implicit behavior that might confuse others.
Simple is better than complex: Simplicity is key; complex solutions should be avoided when a simpler one exists.
Complex is better than complicated: If complexity is necessary, it should be manageable and not unnecessarily convoluted.
Flat is better than nested: Avoid deep nesting of code structures, as they can be hard to follow.
Sparse is better than dense: Leave space in your code; don’t cram too much logic into one line or function.
Readability counts: Writing readable code is crucial because it is often read more than written.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules: Stick to the rules of the language, even in special cases, unless there's a very good reason to do otherwise.
Although practicality beats purity: Practicality can sometimes override strict adherence to purity in design.
Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced: Handle errors gracefully and explicitly when necessary.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess: Code should avoid ambiguity, and if it arises, don't make assumptions.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it: There should be a clear, straightforward way to achieve a task.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch: This is a humorous reference to Python’s creator, Guido van Rossum, who is Dutch.
Now is better than never. Although never is often better than right now: Act promptly, but not hastily.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea: If you can't explain your code easily, it may not be a good approach.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea: Clear and understandable implementations are usually preferable.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!: Use namespaces to organize and structure code more effectively.
